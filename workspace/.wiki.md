# Project Summary
This project is a MERN Stack application designed for deployment with integrated CI/CD and monitoring capabilities. It serves as a robust solution for building, deploying, and managing full-stack applications, providing essential features such as user authentication, data management, and real-time performance monitoring. The application leverages Docker for containerization, Prometheus for metrics collection, and Grafana for visualization, ensuring a scalable and maintainable architecture. Recently, the project has been updated to include the `react-router-dom` package for improved routing functionality.

# Project Module Description
- **Client**: React application serving the frontend with user interfaces for login, registration, and dashboards.
- **Server**: Express.js backend handling API requests, user authentication, and database interactions.
- **Database**: MongoDB for data storage and management.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus collects metrics from the application, while Grafana provides a dashboard for visualization.
- **Deployment**: Automated deployment scripts and Docker configurations streamline the setup process.

# File Description Inventory
- **Dockerfile.client**: Builds the React application and serves it using Nginx.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Defines services for the application, including client, server, MongoDB, Prometheus, and Grafana.
- **nginx.conf**: Configures Nginx to serve the React application and proxy API requests to the backend.
- **monitoring/**: Contains configuration files for Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring the application's performance.
- **server/**: Contains all server-related files, including routes, middleware, models, and the main server setup.
- **src/**: Contains the React application's source code, including components and styles.

# Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

# Usage
1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system. Additionally, run the following command to install the required React routing package:
   ```bash
   pnpm install react-router-dom
   ```
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository to your local machine.
3. **Build and Run**: Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to build and start the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
4. **Access the Application**: After the services are running, you can access the frontend, API, and monitoring dashboards.
